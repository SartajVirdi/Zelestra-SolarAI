# Contributing to This Repository

Thank you for considering contributing! This project follows strict branch protection rules to ensure code quality and team collaboration. Please read and follow these guidelines.

## ðŸš€ Branch protection rules

âœ… All changes **must** go through a **pull request (PR)**.  
âœ… Each PR requires:
- At least **1 approval** from another team member.
- All **conversations resolved** before merging.
- Fresh approval if new commits are pushed (previous approvals are dismissed).

âœ… **Squash merging** is the only allowed merge method.  
âœ… **Force pushes are blocked.**  
âœ… **Deleting the main branch is restricted.**

---

## ðŸ’¬ Code review & collaboration

- Open a pull request for any change, no matter how small.
- Engage in discussions and address all comments before requesting merge approval.
- Respect review feedback â€” we work together to keep the codebase clean!

---

## ðŸŒ± Suggested practices

- Write clear commit messages.
- Keep PRs focused on a single purpose (avoid mixing unrelated changes).
- Test your code locally before pushing.
- If you're adding new features, include usage instructions or update the README.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Branch protections apply to the **`main`** branch (and any other protected branches).
- If unsure about something, open an issue or start a discussion before coding.
