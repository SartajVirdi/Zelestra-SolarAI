# Zelestra-SolarAI
ML-driven solar PV energy prediction and loss attribution system â€” developed as part of the Zelestra x AWS ML Ascend Challenge (Phases 1 &amp; 2). This project estimates theoretical solar generation, quantifies losses (clouds, shading, temperature, soiling, etc.), and provides insightful visualizations.
